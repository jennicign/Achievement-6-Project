# Hospital Readmissions: Insights from Performance Metrics
As a healthcare analyst, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of hospital performance, focusing on the impact of various hospital characteristics on readmission rates and overall ratings. This project aims to provide actionable insights to improve hospital quality, efficiency, and resource allocation.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to explore how different hospital characteristics affect readmission rates and overall performance metrics. The findings will help stakeholders develop strategies to enhance patient care and operational efficiency.

## Key Questions
**Impact of Hospital Characteristics:**

1. How do different hospital characteristics (e.g., type, ownership) impact readmission rates and overall ratings?

**Readmissions and Performance Metrics:**

2. How do hospitals that meet or exceed excess readmissions thresholds differ in their overall ratings and other performance metrics?

**Targeting Improvement Factors:**

3. What common factors (e.g., count of safety measures, hospital type) can be targeted for improvement in hospitals with high readmission rates?

**Condition-Specific Strategies:**

4. How do hospitals' performance comparisons across different conditions (e.g., AMI, HF, PN, COPD) inform condition-specific improvement strategies?

**Regional Performance Analysis:**

5. Are there specific regions where hospitals consistently underperform or overperform in terms of readmission rates and overall ratings?

## Data Sources
This project leverages open-source datasets provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS):

- [Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program Dataset](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/9n3s-kdb3#data-table)
- [Hospital General Information Dataset](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/xubh-q36u#data-table)
- [Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP) - Clinical Outcomes Dataset](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/pudb-wetr)

These datasets are crucial for addressing the outlined business questions and deriving insights to improve hospital performance.
